# Shuffle hustle

A tiny word game influenced by NYT's Spelling Bee. My submission for [Ludum Dare 51](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/shuffle-hustle).

Play the game: [https://shuffle-hustle.com](https://shuffle-hustle.com)

## How to play

Enter as many words as you can using only the displayed letters. Once
the timer runs out, you're toast! Luckily every word you submit gives
you a tiny bit more breathing room.

What's the highest score you can reach?

- The game is over once the countdown timer hits 0.
- Each new word extends the countdown timer (longer words buy you more time).
- The letter bank shuffles randomly every 10 seconds.
- Words must be two or more letters.
- No duplicate words allowed (duplicate letters are fine).
